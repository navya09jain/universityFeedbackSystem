The University Feedback System is designed to centralize student feedback, allowing them to voice opinions, suggestions,
and concerns about various aspects of the university. The platform provides flexibility, enabling students to contribute
either anonymously or with their names. Authentication is implemented through college email addresses, ensuring a
secure and exclusive environment. This approach promotes active participation in the continuous improvement of the
university while prioritizing data security. The system eliminates the need for multiple Google forms, creating a safe
space for all students to be heard and contributing to the enhancement of the university experience.
